# Routed Q8 intermediates for GGUF experts

The existing integer expert path quantizes each token once for gate/up, but
its down output CTAs independently quantize the same routed FP16 intermediate.
For a local output width of 2560, this repeats the intermediate encoder in
80 CTAs. The proposed gate/up epilogue writes standard group32 Q8_1 blocks
once per routed row. Down copies these blocks into shared memory and retains
its existing integer dot, FP16 down boundary and FP32 weighted reduction.
Both paths issue three kernels per layer, including input activation encoding.

Gate/up keeps its FP16 gate/up, SiLU and multiplication boundaries before
encoding. A CTA owns 32 contiguous output rows, so its first warp can encode
one complete group without communication between CTAs. The 16-lane K
partition retains the existing reduction tree. Eight- and four-lane variants
are benchmark candidates; their FP32 summation trees require separate checks.
The unified expert capability policy admits the qualified 16-lane path at
M5/M20. Other batches keep the FP16 intermediate.

The operator accepts either the existing FP16 intermediate or contiguous
Q8_1 blocks. Existing callers keep the FP16 path. The decoder and activation
encoder remain shared with other GGUF integer operators; no independent
codebook or rounding implementation is introduced.

The focused tests compare the 16-lane output bytes with the retained FP16
intermediate and existing encoder, check TP4 down outputs against official
weights, and replay changed inputs and routes. The microbenchmark reads
actual TP4 GGUF banks and measures M5/M20, individual stages and the complete
three-launch pipeline. Every timed operation follows a 32 MiB cache eviction;
reported graph event times include the common event boundary overhead.
Synthetic top10 routing is explicitly labeled and cannot establish the real
model's routing distribution. Whole-model speed and quality remain required.

At the initial compiler checkpoint, IQ3_S gate/up uses 56 registers in the
FP16 and 16/8-lane Q8 variants, and 40 registers in the four-lane variant.
Q2_0 down uses 40 registers with repeated quantization and 38 when reading Q8.
All inspected variants have zero stack and local-memory allocation. These
resource counts establish no speed benefit; GPU timing is reported below.

## Cold-cache qualification

The source-complete SM70 wheel passes 73 GPU checks, including exact 16-lane
Q8 byte comparisons, official weight references and changed-input graph replay.
Nineteen CPU capability checks cover the operator protocol and rejection reasons.
Torch 2.10, CUDA 12.8 and a V100 at observed 1530/877 MHz are used. Every
operation follows a 32 MiB eviction; top10 routing is seeded synthetic routing.

| Gate / down | M5 old / Q8 pipeline, us | M20 old / Q8 pipeline, us |
|---|---:|---:|
|IQ3_S / IQ4_NL|76.80 / 67.58|200.70 / 182.02|
|IQ3_XXS / IQ4_NL|72.70 / 63.49|184.83 / 171.01|
|IQ2_S / Q2_0|74.75 / 63.49|191.49 / 159.74|

All pipelines issue three kernels. The 16-lane schedule wins; eight and four
lanes are not admitted. IQ3_S M5 gate/up remains about 45.06 us, or 384 GB/s
using unique original-weight bytes. This does not meet the 450 GB/s cold-cache
target. The gain comes mainly from avoiding repeated down input quantization.
Model quality and round latency must be measured separately.

An exact XOR/add replacement for packed sign subtraction passes 73 GPU
checks and exhaustive CPU checks of every codebook/sign combination. Two
paired cold repeats retain 45.06 us M5 and 117.76 us M20 Q8 gate/up times.
It is reverted because it provides no measured throughput benefit.

A whole-warp, 32-lane row candidate passes six changed-input graph checks.
Cold IQ3_S M5 gate/up rises from 45.06 to 50.18 us and the complete pipeline
from 67.58 to 72.70 us. M20 gate/up rises from 117.76 to 140.29 us. IQ3_XXS
M5 also regresses, 41.47 to 49.15 us. The candidate is reverted; the qualified
16-lane schedule remains unchanged.

## Whole-model validation with the installed Flash-V100 backend

A complete installed SM70 wheel compares the Q8 intermediate and fused
small-M dense switches together, using Flash-Next IQ3_S, TP4 on four V100s,
FP16 MTP4, FP16 KV, FP32 recurrent state and FULL CUDA graphs. Torch is
2.10/CUDA 12.8. The native Flash-V100 extension is loaded from the installed
package, with no source-checkout overlays.

C1 uses an 8192-token prompt and 256 output tokens. Unobserved round medians
are 23.37/23.39 ms for control and 23.18/23.14 ms for the joint candidate;
both emit 171 tokens in 35 measured intervals. C4 uses 128 input tokens
and 600 output tokens per request: median round time is 50.85 vs 48.12 ms.
Aggregate decode throughput is 194.52 vs 192.99 tokens/s because emitted
tokens per round differ. The joint C1 delta must not be attributed solely
to this expert change. The 18.5 ms phase target remains unmet.

At 64 matched teacher-forcing positions, mean KL is 0.0009271, maximum KL
0.008577, and top-1 agreement is 63/64. Eight natural prompts with 600
output-token budgets give mean draft acceptance 45.796% vs 45.996%; the
paired 95% interval for the change is [-1.593, 1.950] percentage points.
Mean accepted length is 2.8319 vs 2.8398 (change interval [-0.0637, 0.0780]).
Two bounded Chinese completion prompts stop naturally with identical token
IDs. These results support numerical admission under the Q8 activation
contract; they do not establish a material C1 gain.
