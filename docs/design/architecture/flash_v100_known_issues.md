# Flash-V100 baseline limitations (not fixed by A3 refactors)

Baseline: #1060 `8c96e32e56c09d4a3e3112cb5d1a367571f69476`.

- DDTree's Triton branch correction rejects uint8 E4M3 cache storage. In
  eager execution the existing verifier catches that error and falls back to
  dense masked attention; capture rethrows the unsupported-dtype error.
  The synthetic CPU matrix records the existing rejection. This is not GPU
  numerical evidence or a newly supported configuration.
- Prefix-anchored SWA accepts FP16 KV only and rejects DDTree drafting
  metadata. Invalid Cartesian-product combinations are explicit rejection
  cases, never silently skipped as successful attention routes.
- `forward` has three decode-cache reset sites. Capture-prefix and
  capture-small-query returns occur before those sites. Preserve the baseline
  call-site behavior; adding invalidation there would require a separate
  behavior-change investigation.
- With #1060's source-built shared-ABI extension, the policy test
  `test_flash_v100_decode_e4m3_respects_dflash_fp32_policy[False]` expects a
  partition hint of 64 but observes `None`. The parent GPU run reproduced
  this before any safety-net changes; A3 does not repair the expectation
  or alter the strategy. Full pass/fail comparison must retain this result.
- All six `test_runner_does_not_dispatch_short_prefill_as_tail` variants fail
  on #1060 because their synthetic `GPUModelRunner` lacks `device`, which
  `execute_model` reads. The full baseline run reports 1656 passed / 7 failed
  including the E4M3 case above. These fixture repairs are outside A3.

- The first full Flash-Next model run on the #1060 + #1028 integration stopped
  during compiled warmup: its HC caller passes nine arguments but the reused
  #1060 `_C` binary exposes the older eight-argument `sm70_hc_ll_down_out` ABI.
  The #1028 integration adds native changes (including this optional argument);
  its CPU and host-cache unit tests did not exercise this full-model path.
  This is an integration-artifact mismatch, not an A3 attention regression.
  Preserve `a3-step1c/logs/host-parent-core-abi-failure.log` on 54633 and build
  the integration's `_C` in task-owned `a3-native-abi`. Do not repair production
  policy or disable HC to make the parity gate pass. All later A3 host
  integration native sources are identical to this pinned integration, verified
  with `git diff` over CMakeLists.txt and csrc; both comparison arms must use
  the same rebuilt artifact. The original #1060 eight-argument workloads retain
  their original binary contract.

- DFlash2's first real-model baseline with compile mode 3, FULL graphs and a
  1024-token budget fails in compiled warmup: the existing SM70 profile extends
  a compile range to 1025 while DFlash's hidden-state buffer has capacity 1024.
  This is reproduced on #1060 before A3 changes. Preserve
  `dflash-parent-compile-range-failure.log` and its exact engine JSON on 54633.
  The parity workload now explicitly requests compile mode 0 with FULL CUDA
  Graphs and capture size 8 on both arms; the buffer-capacity bug is not repaired
  here. This establishes a separate contract, not success of the failed compile
  configuration. Backend graph replay remains a mandatory numerical/pointer gate.

- The A3 parity recorder initially aliased the requested engine-options
  dictionary. DFlash2 initialization inserted a `ModelConfig` into its nested
  speculative configuration, so saving the result raised `TypeError` after
  successful generation. This is a validation-tool defect, not a passing
  model gate or a backend failure. Snapshot the JSON options before engine
  construction, test nested mutation explicitly, retain the failed log and
  rerun both model arms with the same versioned tool.

- DDTree's real-model #1060 baseline reaches generation but fails before
  producing its route/token record. `DFlashProposer.build_model_inputs_first_pass`
  passes a layer-name-to-slot-tensor dictionary into
  `DFlashQwen3Model.store_context_kv`. That method only recognizes tensor and
  list/tuple forms, so it forwards the dictionary to Triton KV publication,
  which raises `TypeError: failed to specialize argument of type: dict`.
  Both registered DFlash model implementations inherit this method; changing
  model architecture alone does not remove the mismatch. Preserve
  `dflash_ddtree-parent-slot-mapping-failure.log` and
  `spec-queue-slot-mapping-failure.log` on 54633. No A3 attention change fixes
  this pre-existing proposer/model interface bug, and no successful full-model
  DDTree gate is claimed. The independent native DDTree FP16 operator cases
  remain required and do not substitute for the failed model gate.

- The first complete host-FP8 MTP4 pair produces different greedy token IDs
  despite identical #1060 + #1028 production code on both arms. The France
  request matches; the Chinese 64-token answer diverges at zero-based token 21
  (96378 versus 99505). Both arms share all 2,705 production source hashes,
  native-library hashes, recorder, workload and GPU state. Their isolated
  cache/IPC paths differ. Preserve `host-parent.json`, `host-candidate.json`,
  `host-compare.log` and `host-production-source-parity.json` under `a3-step1c`
  on 54633. This is an unresolved baseline reproducibility investigation,
  not a passing host gate or evidence that an A3 production edit caused it.
  An unchanged-parent repeat writes separate `host-parent-repeat` artifacts;
  it must not overwrite the original records or produce `host.done`.

  The unchanged-parent repeat also diverged at token 21 under the same contract
  (96378 versus 99505). France remained identical. This confirms failure to
  reproduce the frozen parent's original output, without establishing the
  numerical cause. Evidence: `host-parent-repeat-report.json` and
  `host-parent-repeat.log`; no acceptance result or original record was changed.
