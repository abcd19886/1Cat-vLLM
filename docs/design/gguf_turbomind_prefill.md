# Canonical GGUF dequantization and FP32-accumulating prefill

The affine dequantization operator reads TurboMind's packed U2/U4/U8 and
bit-plane carriers directly. It reuses the register decoders from mma884 and
writes a transient row-major `[K,N]` FP16 workspace. It retains no second copy
of the quantized weights or persistent FP16 copy of every layer.

The GEMM operator consumes that workspace with explicit `CUBLAS_COMPUTE_32F`
and `CUBLAS_MATH_DISALLOW_REDUCED_PRECISION_REDUCTION`, restoring the handle's
previous math mode after the call. Activations and reconstructed weights stay
FP16; accumulation and reductions stay FP32. Output and scratch tensors are
caller-owned, so allocation can occur before graph capture.

The mixed-precision kernel lifecycle declares this prefill candidate alongside
the fused affine operator. Startup reporting includes family, source format,
M range, graph support and an explicit missing-operator reason. Calibrated physical layouts select the prefill candidate by M range;
unmeasured layouts retain fused MMA and report the missing calibration.
Model loading remains a separate layer.

## Correctness

Eight GPU checks pass: all seven physical affine storage contracts reconstruct
their canonical FP16 weights exactly, including negative scales and zero-scale
constant blocks. Dense GEMM matches the FP32 oracle, CUDA graph replay and
full-graph tracing pass, and the candidate appears in startup reporting.

The first run passed numerical and graph checks but exceeded Dynamo's shared
code-object compilation limit across parameterized cases. Independent cache
reset between contracts resolved the test-harness failure; no operator change
was needed. CPU import/transcode checks also pass (23 tests).

## First real-shape results

V100-SXM2-32GB, CUDA 12.8, Torch 2.10.0+cu128; 100 ms warmup and 20 timed
iterations. Small outputs capture eight operator invocations per replay;
larger outputs use one to bound graph-pool memory. Times below are microseconds
and include canonical dequantization and GEMM. AWQ has the same N/K with valid
group128 storage, and is a performance comparison rather than a quality-equivalent
checkpoint. Shapes come from Qwen3.8-27B UD-Q4_K_M and are full projections.

At M=2048–8192 this candidate is faster than both fused GGUF and same-shape
AWQ for all three projections. M=512 differs by shape: the wide Q3 projection
improves, while Q5/Q6 retain a faster fused path. Thus a single unmeasured
prefill cutoff is insufficient. TP4 projection measurements and default selection follow below.
Additional affine types and installed-wheel validation remain separate gates.
Grouped MoE retains the graph-compatible TurboMind grouped route; these dense
measurements do not claim MoE FFN or model throughput.

## TP4 projection sweep and default selection

All four local projections were measured at M=1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64,
128, 512, 2048 and 8192. The table shows the prefill rows in microseconds;
all three routes use the same repeated-invocation CUDA graph protocol.

Q3_K TP4 and Q4_K TP4 select canonical DQ at M>=512. Q5_K and
Q6_K full/TP4 layouts select it at M>=2048. The full Q3_K projection
also selects it at M>=512. These decisions apply to identical physical
bit width, group size and local dimensions, independent of index values;
other layouts retain fused TurboMind until measured.

Preparation allocates one shared, bounded 178257920-byte FP16 workspace per
device for these calibrated layouts, with layers retaining views. It stores
transient dequantization, not persistent per-layer FP16 weights. Allocation
happens before graph capture. Missing operators, uncalibrated dimensions and
allocation failures each appear as capability reasons; failure retains fused
MMA. No runtime environment variables or lower accumulation precision are
introduced. Grouped MoE continues to use the native grouped operator.

## Installed artifact validation

The normal wheel from revision `1c6a5f8d68` passes 23 CPU and nine GPU
checks in a fresh environment without preload or private libraries. The
installed Q3_K TP4 projection measures M=512 at 362.82 us including DQ,
versus AWQ 467.94 us, and M=8192 at 4104.45 us versus AWQ 5258.14 us.
After integrating main revision `d582b816e6`, the normal core and wheel
were rebuilt and the nine installed GPU checks pass again. Core RPATH
is empty; dependencies are standard CUDA, Torch and system libraries.

The final integration includes LUT4 operators from main. A regenerated
normal wheel from `b2ebfe9ede2eaf9a13a9bf67721ad9bdf10127c5` passes 21 installed GPU checks covering
affine prefill and LUT4. Source, wheel and installed core hashes match;
RPATH/RUNPATH remain empty. The affine prefill arithmetic is unchanged.
