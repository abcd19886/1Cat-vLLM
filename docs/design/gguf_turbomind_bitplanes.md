# GGUF affine bit planes on SM70

Q3_K, Q5_0/Q5_1, Q5_K and Q6_K retain their integer codes and normalize into
U2/U4 low planes, one/two-bit high planes and FP16 affine coefficients.
Activation precision and FP32 MMA accumulation follow native TurboMind.
Model integration is separate.

| Source | Low/high widths | Group | Coefficients |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Q3_K | 2 + 1 | 16 | Expand signed nested scales; additive min is -4 scale |
| Q5_0 | 4 + 1 | 32 | Source scale; additive min is -16 scale |
| Q5_1 | 4 + 1 | 32 | Source scale and additive min |
| Q5_K | 4 + 1 | 32 | Expand nested scale/min products |
| Q6_K | 4 + 2 | 16 | Expand signed nested scales; additive min is -32 scale |

Q5/Q6 use an aligned 64-bit carrier with FP16 scale/min in its lower word
and the little-endian high plane in its upper word. Q3_K instead uses a
32-bit carrier: FP16 scale and 16 high bits. Its centered form is
`(code - 4) * scale`; preparation checks exact equality of the independently
rounded min and `-4 * scale`. A mismatch requires the reference fallback,
rather than changing the rounded coefficients. All 5,570,560 groups of the
measured 27B Q3_K tensor satisfy this condition. The carrier reduces Q3's
canonical storage from six to four bits per weight, including metadata.

Low codes reuse the native packed U2/U4 weight layout. Register decoding
combines both planes before FP16 affine FMA (Q5/Q6) or centered multiplication
(Q3), then mma884. No code values are requantized.

This metadata changes the decoding contract, so its GEMM descriptor uses a
separate bit-plane and centered-Q3 quantization tags. Dense tuning also uses independent keys
for widths 3/5/6. Existing U2/U4/U8 descriptors retain their original tag.
Tiles start on complete metadata groups. Canonical groups, rather than the
original GGUF superblocks, govern TP slicing.

## Correctness

Twenty-three CPU checks pass across these codecs and the existing affine
codecs. Ten new checks compare source formulas with official reconstruction,
preserve all bit-plane codes and cover TP4 K slices that cut source blocks.
The initial source extension passes 42 GPU checks (one existing raw Q4_K
K=160 fixture is skipped), including M=1–8192, grouped GEMM with distinct
and empty experts, graph replay and framework full-graph tracing.

The first full GPU run lacked installed package metadata in its test
environment and could not identify the CUDA platform after the eight new
direct-operator checks passed. Installing the declared normal package
metadata resolved this test-environment failure; the complete run then passed.

The final normal wheel passes 43 GPU checks (one existing fixture skipped) in
an isolated installed runtime without source-path overrides or preloaded
libraries. The wheel, its installed core and its packaged core agree:

- Compiled source: `ed7a9e9be3`.
- Wheel: `1cat_vllm-1.5.2.dev231+ged7a9e9be.precompiled-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl`.
- Wheel SHA256: `052da74dbf466cde6e35a96e99fc452ecbd4e2447f8a254aa74e7a274ea4aef8`.
- Core SHA256: `73e882e58a68c4576d83a6002dbb7d92a5e3d87c543bce9629bdbf0de11abb14`.
- The core has no RPATH/RUNPATH; the packaged GGUF reference extension is unchanged.

## Initial measurements and profiling

Measurements use V100-SXM2-32GB, CUDA 12.8 and Torch 2.10.0+cu128, FP16
activations, 100 ms warmup per route and 20 event-timed iterations. Graph
capture warms its stream and three replay calls. These are full projection
shapes from the actual Qwen3.8-27B UD-Q4_K_M file, not TP4 model throughput.
The AWQ comparison has the same N/K with valid group128 U4 storage and is
not a quality-equivalent checkpoint. Cached FP16 excludes dequantization.

The initial bit-plane path is slower than AWQ at concurrency and prefill
shapes. Q6_K N=5120/K=6144/M=8192 takes about 9500 us versus 7073 us for
AWQ and 6270 us for dequantization plus cuBLAS. This is a rejected performance
baseline, not evidence that the performance objective has been reached.

The matched-shape dispatch probe selects CTA128x256x16 for both Q6 and AWQ,
with identical shared-memory size and one active CTA per SM. Q6 uses 252
registers versus AWQ's 250. Static disassembly contains 48 integer-to-FP16
conversion instructions for Q6 versus two for AWQ, supporting a register
decoder experiment that combines both planes as integer mantissa bits before
converting pairs to FP16. Static instruction counts are not dynamic counters.
Nsight Compute hardware-counter collection was denied by the driver; no
counter-based bottleneck claim is made.

The paired decoder restores integers below 64 using the FP16 1024 mantissa
trick. All eleven new GPU checks pass after this change. A normal wheel also
passes 23 CPU and 42 GPU checks in a fresh installed runtime. Q6's matched
M=8192 shape improves from 9500 to 8134 us, versus AWQ's 7099 us; a separate
same-shape probe gives 8057 versus 7043 us. The remaining gap is material.

The compact centered-Q3 variant passes twelve new GPU checks, including a
regression that rejects nonredundant min coefficients near FP16 underflow.
Its real 27B M=1/512/8192 probe measures 96.31/1539.53/23087.62 us versus
AWQ's 65.84/1395.97/20494.28 us. The full updated sweep appears below. The initial
tables below retain the original decoder's negative baseline. Model connection
remains pending performance and model-level quality checks.

## Updated operator measurements

Times are microseconds from the same graph/eager benchmark contract above.
Q3 uses the compact centered carrier; Q5/Q6 use paired register decoding.
Flash-Next tensors below are dense/shared projections. Its downloaded file
has no Q3/Q5/Q6 stacked expert tensors; grouped correctness uses distinct
expert fixtures, while actual affine expert speed evidence is the Q2_0
measurement in `gguf_turbomind_u2.md`. No full FFN or model speed is claimed.

At M=2048–8192, dequantization plus cuBLAS is faster than the fused
bit-plane kernel for these projections. A canonical dequantization
operator with FP32-accumulating GEMM is the next candidate; reference
timings alone do not implement or select that route. Small-M and
intermediate-M defaults also require the completed candidate comparison.
The remaining AWQ gap is recorded rather than treated as a completed
performance objective. Model integration and model-level quality remain
separate work.
