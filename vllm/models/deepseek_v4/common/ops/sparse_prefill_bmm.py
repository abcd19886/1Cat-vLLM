"""Sparse MLA prefill attention as one gather and two batched matmuls.

The Triton prefill kernel scatters the key reads head by head. Every head of a
token reads the same keys, so gathering them once per token and handing the
rest to the BLAS library does the same work 5-10x faster on V100 and RTX 8000
(64 heads, 64-256 query tokens, 384-640 keys) and lands closer to an fp64
reference than the Triton kernel does.
